## What's New in v1.1.0

### New Features
- **Follow-up Tasks**: Continue working on completed specs by adding new tasks to existing implementations. The system automatically re-enters planning mode and integrates with your existing documentation and context.
- **Screenshot Support for Feedback**: Attach screenshots to your change requests when reviewing tasks, providing visual context for your feedback alongside text comments.
- **Unified Task Editing**: The Edit Task dialog now includes all the same options as the New Task dialog—classification metadata, image attachments, and review settings—giving you full control when modifying tasks.

### Improvements
- **Enhanced Kanban Board**: Improved visual design and interaction patterns for task cards, making it easier to scan status, understand progress, and work with tasks efficiently.
- **Screenshot Handling**: Paste screenshots directly into task descriptions using Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac) for faster documentation.
- **Draft Auto-Save**: Task creation state is now automatically saved when you navigate away, preventing accidental loss of work-in-progress.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed task editing to support the same comprehensive options available in new task creation
